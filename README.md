Hey, my name is Anna.

I am an aspiring web developer with a penchant for metaphors, I find that they help me understand code concepts better.
Currently I am a <a href="http://makersacademy.com">Maker</a> and this repo is my attempt at 
1) Keeping tabs on all the new code concepts I'm learning and 
2) Breaking them down into digestable metaphors to ensure I understand them completely.
