Hey, my name is Anna.

I am an aspiring web developer with a penchant for metaphors, I find that they help me understand code concepts better.
Right now I am a <a href="http://makersacademy.com">Maker</a> and this repo is my attempt at keeping tabs on all the new
code concepts I'm learning and breaking them down into digestable metaphors to ensure I understand them completely.
